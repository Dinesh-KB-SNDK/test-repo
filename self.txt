1. Positive attitude (Always taken my peers feedback as constructive one and never gave up on tasks)
2. Seen the problems as opportunities (Worked in multiple customer related issues and interacted with counterpart teams to recreate the issues)
3. Team player who can work as IC also (Till now i have worked under different leadership/team and i am sure that no one had any issues with me.  Also, currently leading 15 member team).
4. Worked on multiple initiatives and deployed them successfully.
Given an opportunity i am very much interested to work with great people.
